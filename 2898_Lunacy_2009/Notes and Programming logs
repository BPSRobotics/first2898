Default Robot Main Program
--------------------------------

This sample implements the "default program" that was preloaded on
your cRIO when it came from the factory. This program has both Autonomous
and Operator Control code as described in the "Out of the box" directions.

You can use this as a slightly more advanced template as a starting point
for your own robot projects, or just to see how some more advanced programming
works.
